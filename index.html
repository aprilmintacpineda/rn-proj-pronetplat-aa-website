        I was originally going to name it <strong>Acquiant</strong> but it’s already taken, then I thought of naming it <strong>EntrepConnect</strong> which was also already taken as well so I just named it <strong>Entrepic</strong>.

        We, entrepreneurs like to go to networking events and other similar business event to expand our reach and find business opportunities or even just problems to solve and we can turn into a business. When going to such events it is usual for us to bring business cards with us and give it to others and of course we expect them to have business cards of their own as well. This has been the way to go for us to network and connect, but there is are some rough edges about this that makes this inconvenient.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business cards can get lost, torn apart, or fade out.</li>
        <li>Business cards doesn’t keep a connection.</li>
        <li>Business cards are usually expensive, and then can run out.</li>
        <li>With this approach, your are basically limited to just giving your business card, and in a setup like where we are now, you can’t really do that, hence, making new entrepreneurial connection is harder.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Entrepic aims to solve all of that by providing a <strong>platform</strong> and a <strong>tool</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Entrepic is privacy and security oriented, because we believe that <strong>privacy and security are not optional and should not be compromised for the sake of connecting with others.</strong></p>

  <h3>Add others to your contact list</h3>
  <p>
    You can scan other user's in-app qr code to quickly send them a contact request. Once they have accepted it, they will be added to your contact list and you will be able to see each others contact details. <strong>When you're offline</strong>, you can still scan in-app qr codes and the next time you go online, the app will automatically send contact requests to the qr codes you scanned.
