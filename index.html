        Picture this, you're currently sitting on a networking event, the last
        speaker is preparing and is about to start shortly, you thought to
        yourself,
        <i>"I just bought 300 calling cards 20 days ago, I should be good"</i>,
        then the networking event continues, after giving out 20 calling cards,
        you realized you just ran out of calling cards to give.

        This scenario is more common than you think! Not only is under-buying a
        problem, over-buying is also a problem, you most likely have lots of
        calling cards you bought long ago and are just lying around somewhere,
        unused.

        Entrepic allows you to quickly add people to your contacts by scanning
        their QR codes. Once you've scanned their QR codes, they will receive a
        contact request from you.

        have accepted your contact request.
